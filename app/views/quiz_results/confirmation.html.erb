      <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl py-10 text-center">Why Does an Airfoil Generate Lift?</h2>
      <p class="p-text px-5">
        An airfoil is the shape of a wing and it generates lift through the application of Bernoulli's principle. As air glides across the curved upper surface of the airfoil, it covers a longer path compared to the air beneath the flat lower surface. Consequently, the air above the wing is forced to move at a faster pace in contrast to the air underneath, making an area of reduced pressure above the wing and a corresponding zone of heightened pressure beneath it. This difference in pressure creates an overall upward force on the wing, commonly identified as lift. It is this lifting force that gives airplanes the capability to achieve flight.

      <p class="p-text px-5 pb-5">
        Your Discovery Flight is designed to give you a taste of what it's like to be a pilot. You'll spend approximately 30 minutes in the air with one of our certified flight instructors, who will guide you through the basics of flying and answer any questions you may have. You'll also have the opportunity to take the controls and experience the thrill of flying first-hand.
