  </div>

  <div class="max-w-3xl mt-10 px-3">
    <p class="pb-10">
An Instrument Rating (IR) is a rating that most pilots get after their private pilot certificate.
Having an instrument rating allows you to safely operate aircraft under conditions of reduced visibility and adverse weather. 
With an instrument rating, a pilot gains the ability to fly and navigate using the aircraft's instruments alone without external visual references. This level of expertise represents a significant milestone in a pilot's career, demonstrating their capacity to handle complex and challenging situations with precision and confidence.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-10">
      Obtaining an Instrument Rating not only expands a pilot's capabilities but also broadens their horizons in the world of aviation. 
      It opens up opportunities to fly in a wider range of weather conditions when visual flight is not feasible. This rating is particularly valuable for those pursuing careers in commercial aviation, as it is a requirement for airline transport pilots. The rigorous training and testing involved in earning an instrument rating contributes significantly to a pilot's overall proficiency and aeronautical decision making abilities, making them safer and more capable pilot.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-10">
      An Instrument Rating is not just about adding another credential to a pilot's resume. But rather, it represents a mastery of the precision flying and a commitment to safety. 
      Having an instrument rating allows pilots to handle challenging scenarios and navigate the skies safely, when weather is less than ideal.

Starting your Instrument Rating journey is an exciting step in your pilot training. At Sun City Aviation Academy, we'll pair you up with a certified flight instructor instrument (CFII) who specializes in instrument flight training. During this phase of your training, you'll need to accumulate a minimum of 50 hours of cross country flight time as the pilot in command (PIC), including 40 hours of dedicated instrument training. Throughout your Instrument Rating training, you'll focus on developing the skill of flying solely by reference to instruments. This includes guided practice in navigating various instrument approaches and holding patterns.
